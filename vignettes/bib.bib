abstract = {Shotgun proteomic investigations rely on the algorithmic assignment of mass spectra to peptides. The quality of these matches is therefore a cornerstone in the analysis and has been the subject of numerous recent developments. In order to establish the benefits of novel algorithms, they are applied to reference samples of known content. However, these were recently shown to be either too simple to resemble typical real-life samples or as leading to results of lower accuracy as the method itself. Here, we describe how to use the proteome of Pyrococcus furiosus , a hyperthermophile, as a standard to evaluate proteomics identification workflows. Indeed, we prove that the Pyrococcus furiosus proteome provides a valid method for detecting random hits, comparable to the decoy databases currently in popular use, but we also prove that the Pyrococcus furiosus proteome goes squarely beyond the decoy approach by also providing many hundreds of highly reliable true positive hits. Searching the Pyrococcus furiosus proteome can thus be used as a unique test that provides the ability to reliably detect both false positives as well as proteome-scale true positives, allowing the rigorous testing of identification algorithms at the peptide and protein level.},

abstract = {One of the critical gaps in malaria transmission biology and surveillance is our lack of knowledge about Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte biology, especially sexual dimorphic development and how sex ratios that may influence transmission from the human to the mosquito. Dissecting this process has been hampered by the lack of sex-specific protein markers for the circulating, mature stage V gametocytes. The current evidence suggests a high degree of conservation in gametocyte gene complement across Plasmodium, and therefore presumably for sex-specific genes as well. To better our understanding of gametocyte development and subsequent infectiousness to mosquitoes, we undertook a Systematic Subtractive Bioinformatic analysis (filtering) approach to identify sex-specific P. falciparum NF54 protein markers based on a comparison with the Dd2 strain, which is defective in producing males, and with syntenic male and female proteins from the reanalyzed and updated P. berghei (related rodent malaria parasite) gametocyte proteomes. This produced a short list of 174 male- and 258 female-enriched P. falciparum stage V proteins, some of which appear to be under strong diversifying selection, suggesting ongoing adaptation to mosquito vector species. We generated antibodies against three putative female-specific gametocyte stage V proteins in P. falciparum and confirmed either conserved sex-specificity or the lack of cross-species sex-partitioning. Finally, our study provides not only an additional resource for mass spectrometry-derived evidence for gametocyte proteins but also lays down the foundation for rational screening and development of novel sex-partitioned protein biomarkers and transmission-blocking vaccine candidates.},

Here we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript in the Database Issue in 2013. PRIDE Archive constitutes a complete redevelopment of the original PRIDE, comprising a new storage backend, data submission system and web interface, among other components. PRIDE Archive supports the most-widely used PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative) data standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements the data requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium. The wide adoption of ProteomeXchange within the community has triggered an unprecedented increase in the number of submitted data sets (around 150 data sets per month). We outline some statistics on the current PRIDE Archive data contents. We also report on the status of the PRIDE related stand-alone tools: PRIDE Inspector, PRIDE Converter 2 and the ProteomeXchange submission tool. Finally, we will give a brief update on the resources under development 'PRIDE Cluster' and 'PRIDE Proteomes', which provide a complementary view and quality-scored information of the peptide and protein identification data available in PRIDE Archive.},

Noble (2015) therefore urged researchers to remove irrelevant peptides from the database prior to searching to improve statistical power. We here however, argue that both the classical as well as Noble{\textquoteright}s revised method produce suboptimal peptide identifications and have problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Instead, we show that searching for all expected peptides, and removing irrelevant peptides prior to FDR calculation results in more reliable identifications at controlled FDR level than the classical strategy that discards irrelevant peptides post FDR calculation, or than Noble{\textquoteright}s strategy that discards irrelevant peptides prior to searching. We provide an implementation of our strategy as a user-friendly web-based tool at http://iomics.ugent.be/saas/.},
